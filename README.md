# monstarlab_test

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is a gallery app.
The images are called from the unsplashed api.
Only one page worth of images are shows at the beiging, more will load when you scroll.
You can tap on an image to see full screen.
You can tap on the fullscreen image to see the option button at the top right corner, which will hav two options, download & share.
You can download the image in your gallery by clikcing download or share it by clicking share.
You can zoom in on the picture for a better view.

There is a development flavor & production flavor. However, they don't do much right now. For the image preview I've used the typical CachedNetworkImage.
